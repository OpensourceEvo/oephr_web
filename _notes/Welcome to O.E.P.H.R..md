## Opensource Evolution Protocols for the Human Race

I offer opensource trainings and strategies to aid in the evolution of our species. That's just a fancy way of saying we have free strategies and techniques to improve mental health and quality of life.

The current project I am working on is modeling mindfulness, meditation, lucid dreaming, and astral projection using the Neurlo-Linguistics Programming (NLP) framework, which I will then integrate with NLP. I expect the results will upgrade a majority of the NLP patterns into more advanced techniques and produce a flavor of NLP which can be learned and practiced completely solo if one chooses. 

I will be updating this site as I flesh out my model more and make new discoveries or insights. 

I have a public forum on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/oephr/) to post questions or have discussions about anything related to this website.

If you would like additional help applying any of the strategies or concepts mentioned on this website, I offer [[coaching|one-on-one coaching]] to accelerate your learning.
