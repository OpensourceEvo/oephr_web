In this article I will explain how some of the major NLP modalities fits into each of the three main spiritual disciplines: mindfulness, lucid dreaming and astral projection.


## Mindfulness

Mindfulness from an NLP perspective can be thought of as Sensory Acuity with the objective of achieving [[Mental State of Lucidity]]. Where as traditional sensory acuity primarily focuses on detecting same/differences in the environment. 

Mindfulness can also be thought of as State Management. Because the mindfulness state ([[Mental State of Lucidity]]) is calming and allows a person to easily access his or her resources.


## Lucid Dreaming and Astral Projection

Here's where it gets good. I would classify both lucid dreaming and astral projection as advanced forms of hypnosis, submodalities, parts integration, time line therapy. Because with lucid dreaming and astral projection, a person has direct access to their subconscious landscape and can experience the subconscious fully and completely with all 5 sensory modalities. 

And I would go further and claim that lucid dreaming and astral projection is the only true form of hypnosis where the individual has complete autonomy because they lead their own experience without the aid of a hypnotist.
